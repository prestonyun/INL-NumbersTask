# INL-NumbersTask
Tests working memory and response time. Participants are required to press a response key when three even or odd numbers are displayed sequentially.

# Details

The delay between each displayed number can be edited in the BackEnd.java file.

Sequences are contained in groups of 5 numbers, and 40% of groups contain a 3-in-a-row even or odd sequence. Each program runs for 12 minutes, after a 15 second countdown.

In the examples folder, there are three runnable jar files:

The 1000ms program displays 144 groups, with 58 containing a valid sequence.

The 800ms program displays 180 groups, with 72 containing a valid sequence.

The 600ms program displays 240 groups, with 96 containing a valid sequence.
