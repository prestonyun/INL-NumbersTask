# INL-NumbersTask
Tests working memory and response time. Participants are required to press a response key when three even or odd numbers are displayed sequentially.

# Details

The delay between each displayed number can be edited in the BackEnd.java file.

Sequences are contained in groups of 5 numbers, and 40% of groups contain a 3-in-a-row even or odd sequence. Each program runs for 12 minutes, after a 15 second countdown.

In the examples folder, there are three runnable jar files:

> 1000ms: 144 groups, 58 valid sequences

> 800ms: 180 groups, 72 valid sequences

> The 600ms: 240 groups, 96 valid sequences
